# SwiftUI-practice-repo
This repository is for keeping track of my SwiftUI practice

# Topic Covered
* ## Gestures used in SwiftUI
    * **[LongPressGesture](PracticeSiwftUI/PracticeSiwftUI/LongPressGesture):** functions a lot like the "Tap Gesture," except we can specify the amount of time that a user must press and hold before the action executes! 
    * **MagnificationGesture:** to-do
